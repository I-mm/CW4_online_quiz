## Overview

This website TMP (Test Make Perfect) is an online English testing platform. Users can log in and register to visit our website and conduct online English testing. Before the test, users can set the pass line to satisfy their personal needs. During the test, the website will randomly call up a series of questions from the database, and timing the answering process. The website has the corresponding re-exam mechanism and the corresponding score algorithm for the time-out behaviour of the first test. After the end of the test, the website will generate the user’s scores, answer time, correct answers and so on. Users can also go back to the home page to see the results report.

5. Re-exam logic 

   If the user fails to complete the first test within the specified time, the website will pop up an alert to let users do this test again. The final score is generated by the average of the two marks. After the second test, the website will jump to the exam report page and will not have third chance.
